# ASU : Auto Snap Uninstaller

How to Use This Script:

Make it executable: chmod +x asu.sh

Run it with sudo: sudo ./asu.sh

#Important Notes:
This will completely remove Snap from your system, including all Snap applications.

Some Ubuntu systems may have core functionality dependent on Snap (like Firefox in newer versions). You may need to install these applications from other sources (like .deb packages or Flatpak).

After running this script, you won't be able to install or use any Snap packages.
